# Data Portfolio Project

## Overview
The Data Portfolio Project is designed to showcase various data analysis and machine learning techniques using Python. This project provides code templates and step-by-step guidance for learning and implementing data processing, visualization, and machine learning models.

## Libraries Used
This project utilizes the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- flask

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd data-portfolio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Processing**: Use the functions in `src/analysis/data_processing.py` to load and clean your data.
2. **Visualization**: Create visualizations using the functions in `src/analysis/visualization.py`.
3. **Model Training**: Define and train your machine learning models in `src/models/ml_models.py`.
4. **API Endpoints**: Serve your models using the API defined in `src/api/endpoints.py`.
5. **Testing**: Run the tests located in the `tests` directory to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
6. **Examples**: Refer to the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/examples.ipynb` for practical examples and guidance.
