# Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing data from various sources. It includes modules for data extraction, transformation, and loading into a target destination.

## Directory Structure
- `src/etl/`: Contains the ETL logic.
  - `extract.py`: Functions to extract data from databases and APIs.
  - `transform.py`: Functions to clean and transform the extracted data.
  - `load.py`: Functions to load the transformed data into a database or data warehouse.
  
- `src/pipelines/`: Contains the main pipeline orchestration.
  - `main_pipeline.py`: Orchestrates the ETL process.

- `src/utils/`: Contains utility functions and configuration handling.
  - `config.py`: Loads configuration settings.
  - `helpers.py`: Contains reusable utility functions.

- `src/tests/`: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - `test_pipeline.py`: Unit tests for the ETL pipeline functions.

- `config/`: Contains configuration files.
  - `config.yaml`: Configuration settings in YAML format.

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
  - `data_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and visualization.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure the settings in `config/config.yaml` as needed.

## Usage
To run the ETL pipeline, execute the following command:
```
python src/pipelines/main_pipeline.py
```
